# Constrained-N-Queens
The N-queens is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Wiki has detailed description of the problem and the history of the problem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle. To make this project interesting, a constraint was placed as the programmer knows the location of the first queen placed.
